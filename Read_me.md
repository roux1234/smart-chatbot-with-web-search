# Smart Chatbot with Web Search

A lightweight, beginner-friendly conversational chatbot using **LangChain** and **DuckDuckGo Search API**, integrated with real-time web search results to answer factual queries. This project demonstrates the power of modern Python libraries and APIs to build intelligent chatbots without relying on expensive services.

## Features

- **Conversational Chatbot**: Uses LangChain for managing the chatbot's memory and conversation flow.
- **Real-Time Web Search**: Fetches real-time search results using DuckDuckGo API to answer factual queries.
- **Lightweight**: No paid APIs required for core functionality, making it cost-effective.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple, plug-and-play functionality for users with clear setup instructions.
- **Modular Design**: The project is designed to be beginner-friendly, allowing for easy modifications and extensions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the development of the chatbot.
- **LangChain**: A framework that facilitates building conversational models with memory.
- **DuckDuckGo Search API**: Fetches real-time web search results to assist in answering factual queries.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library is used for NLP tasks and accessing pre-trained language models.
- **Torch**: Used for deep learning tasks, particularly for language model operations.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to external services like the DuckDuckGo API.
